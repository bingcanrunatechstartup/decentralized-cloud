Here's a draft design proposal for the protocol and message flow for a customer querying, bidding, and reserving compute resources on your decentralized cloud computing platform:

1. The customer sends a `query` message to the Host Provider Server containing their desired compute resource specifications (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage) in JSON format.

```json
{
    "type": "query",
    "data": {
        "cpu": 4,
        "ram": 8,
        "storage": 100
    }
}
```

2. The Host Provider Server processes the query and returns a list of available compute resources from different host providers that match the customer's specifications.

```json
{
    "type": "queryResponse",
    "data": [
        {
            "providerId": 1,
            "cpu": 4,
            "ram": 8,
            "storage": 100,
            "pricePerHour": 0.10
        },
        {
            "providerId": 2,
            "cpu": 4,
            "ram": 8,
            "storage": 120,
            "pricePerHour": 0.12
        }
    ]
}
```

3. The customer reviews the available options and selects one by sending a `bid` message to the Host Provider Server containing their chosen provider ID and bid price.

```json
{
    "type" :
