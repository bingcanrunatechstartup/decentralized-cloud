Here are some further questions: 1. For the libary at github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/tfexec , how do I query output values after successfully applying the provisioning script? Also, what does "context.Background()" mean? 2. I would like to add a second high level function for the SDK to let user enter into a SSH session on the provisioned VM. It should take the values returned from "client.ReserveResources" as arguments (as well as an additional SSH private key that is kept client side), spin up the wireguard network using the config, then connect to the VM using SSH. After these question, I would like to move on to another part - can you write me a Linux shell script that would install the host provider agent program we have as a systemd daemon service? Do we need to compile the golang program first? Provide source code of any additional file you consider important to this task.
