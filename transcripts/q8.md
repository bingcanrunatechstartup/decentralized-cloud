That's very helpful, thanks! I have some question on some details: 1. Is ZeroMQ agnostic on the data format (eg sending in binary) and it is up to us to choose one? I'm unexperienced in goland, suggest a data transport format for me in this context and show sample code to decode after receiving message from queue. (also show sample code to put message on ZeroMQ queue in golang) 2. Are there values generated or returned after the terraform script execute successfully? (e.g. IP address allocated), in such case how can the program above retrieve this piece of info after the command return? 3. For Wireguard setup, are we responsible for creating a local network in Linux first, or is just reusing the libvirt private network enough?
