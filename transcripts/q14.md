one minor question: is it possible to list all keys in a DHT in the example above? If yes, just mention the name and signature of the function in the package that can do it is okay. I also have another question on doing cryptography in golang. How to perform digital signature of a message using assymetric key? How to verify the signature? Finally, in the libp2p code example above, can I turn the part "_,err = s.Write(data)" (and later "data,_= ioutil.ReadAll(s)") into an async pattern? Is callback supported in go like in NodeJS, or promise, or something else?
