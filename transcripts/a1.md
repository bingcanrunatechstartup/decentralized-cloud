It sounds like you have a clear idea of the components and architecture for your decentralized cloud computing platform. For visualizing the system architecture and interactions between components, some useful diagrams could be a **component** diagram and a **sequence** diagram. A component diagram can show the high-level structure of the system and how its various components interact with each other. A sequence diagram can show the flow of messages between components in a specific scenario, such as querying or reserving cloud resources.

As for designing the protocol for querying, auctioning, and reserving cloud resources, it might be helpful to consider factors such as security, scalability, and fault tolerance. You could also look into existing protocols used in similar systems for inspiration.
