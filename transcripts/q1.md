Hi, I would like to design and implement a Proof Of Concept for a decentralized cloud computing platform. Compared to others, we want to design it so that people who wants to be a host/compute provider can do it on relatively low end computers, and we want to improve usability by using a peer to peer approach and devising a platform neutral protocol. As a first draft, complexities of OS and hardware will be abstracted away to some extent by reusing existing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as terraform and ansible. First, we think that our software will have these components: 1. host provider server: it accept queries and reservation request from people interested in renting compute, and perform the auction process. 2. host provider agent: it is responsible for actually provisioning the compute resources once a cloud renting deal is established. It communicates with host provider server via a message bus, perhaps ZeroMQ due to the lightweight requirement. 3. Frontend UI: Provide a visual interface for customer to use the cloud. 4. SDK library for developer: provide low level, programmatic access to all aspects of the cloud, as well as end-to-end functions to rent cloud resources, for integration into other IaC tools or their workflow. 5. Command Line Client: Similar to 4 and is in fact a thin wrapper of it, for convinence. Based on this info, can you help me draw the most important mermaid UML diagrams that you think can help describe this system? I would also like help on designing the protocol to query, auction, and reserve cloud resources. We will be using libp2p for the p2p network, and simple message passing (and hence direct communication between prospective customer and host provider) will be used.
