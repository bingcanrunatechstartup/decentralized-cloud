Sure! Here's an updated version of the draft design proposal for the protocol and message flow for a customer querying, bidding, and reserving compute resources on your decentralized cloud computing platform that incorporates your requested changes:

4. The Host Provider Server processes the bid and returns a `bidResponse` message indicating whether the bid was successful or not. If the bid is not immediately accepted or rejected by the host provider, it is placed in a queue to wait for other possible bids until a timer runs out.

```json
{
    "type": "bidResponse",
    "data": {
        "status": "pending"
    }
}
```

5. If the bid was successful or pending, the customer can then send a `reserve` message to confirm their reservation of the compute resources. This message can include additional information such as which VM image to use and an Ansible script to automatically customize their VM.

```json
{
    "type": "reserve",
    "data": {
        "providerId": 1,
        <VMImage>ubuntu-20.04</VMImage>,
        <AnsibleScript>...</AnsibleScript>
    }
}
```

6. The Host Provider Server processes the reservation and returns a `reserveResponse` message containing details of the reserved compute resources. This includes information on how to connect to their VM using WireGuard VPN.

```json
{
    "type": "reserveResponse",
    <WireGuardConfig>...</WireGuardConfig>,
    <IPAddress>4</IPAddress>,
    <IPAddress>22</IPAddress>,
    <IPAddress>ssh</IPAddress>
}
```

This updated design allows for asynchronous processing of bids by host providers and incorporates your technical decisions regarding virtualization using qemu/kvm and access via WireGuard VPN.

Is there anything else you would like me to add or change?
