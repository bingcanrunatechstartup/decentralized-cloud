Let's continue the prototype implementation effort. 1. While the above do work, I am curious about whether there is a terraform SDK libary in golang that would let me directly apply the script by making a function call. If yes, show me sample code snippet on usage. 2. Show me the function signatures for our SDK library (again in golang). Its design should be that there will be a roughly one-one mapping between each message type in the design draft above and corresponding function (these are considered low level for those developer using our cloud who need more granular control) 3. Continuing from 2, show me the code for a high level function that uses the function you proposed in 2 to orchestrate an end-to-end flow of reserving cloud resource. It should accept as argument the amount of resources required, bidding price, SSH public key, and any other argument you think is neccesary. It should return the private IP address and wireguard config to connect to the private network. Show usage example. (async design is acceptable too if you think it is better)
