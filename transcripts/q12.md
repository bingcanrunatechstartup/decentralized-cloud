Next, let's move on to the peer to peer part of the system. We plan to implement it using the libp2p golang SDK library. Assume we have a bootstrap list of nodes stored as a file on local filesystem. Show me sample code implementation of one of our SDK function (say, " Bid(providerID int, bidPrice float64) " ), where it will contact the peer using libp2p, send it a Bid message with the JSON payload per our design draft above, then wait for a reply message. As an additional question, does libp2p allow us to cooperatively store data using DHT? You may use code to illustrate how it is done if yes.
