Thanks. Next, I want to move to a rapid prototype implementation. We identified the host provider agent as the more challenging part, though we're also interested in getting the SDK library done as higher pirority. Can you help me write the host provider agent? It should accept message from the ZeroMQ queue that request provisioning of compute resources to customer. It read the parameter in the message specifying details such as number of vcpu and memory of the VM, network etc. Then it perform action on behave of the host provider by executing a terraform provisioning file with those data filled in as specified by customer. After that, it should execute a ansible script against that VM to customize it. Finally, it should return the IP address and other relevant info, placing it on the ZeroMQ queue. The terraform provisioning script should spin up a VM with libvirt, and also setup wireguard network. The programming language used for the host provider agent and SDK is golang. Show me the code for both the host provider agent and the terraform script. You may use any library to help as you deem fit.
