We want to design our system in a way that lean more towards the peer to peer side and try to avoid reliance on blockchain technology. The DHT idea is indeed interesting as it is one of the feature provided by the libp2p library we plan to use - for example, we may use it for a decentralized marketplace where host provider can submit their current inventory of available resources, then customer can query all avaliable resources and compare competing offers without having to know the location of these providers beforehand. I think we may do it in the next iteration. For now, we want to focus on designing the protocol. I think this protocol will resemble traditional client-server interactions in web 2.0 app. So I would like to clarify: what would a typical flow for a customer querying, bidding, and then reserving/confirming compute resources look like, and what type of messages would be exchanged? What data/field/attributes would these message likely contain. (We prefer JSON format for the data) Answer in the form of a draft design proposal targeted for software engineer. Use sequence diagram (in mermaid) where helpful. Thanks.
