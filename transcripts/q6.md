Modify your design to allow for the possibility that a bid need not be immediately answered in the affirmation or negative by host provider (although he may choose to do so). Only show the changed parts. Maybe this is some sort of async pattern? Polling is acceptable for us given the technical limitation of the underlying network. (Although libp2p technically supports pubsub) Another refinement we would like to make is to incorporate some preliminary decision we've made on the infra / technical side: qemu/kvm virtualization would be used, the host provider will spin up a VM using terraform plus libvirt, then to let customer access the VM, since host provider are often people renting out their PCs at home using residential ISP, they are behind firewall and usually have no public IP. Therefore, we would automatically setup a wireguard VPN that is per-tenant and the customer can then connect to their VM this way. Moreover, we would like the option for customer to specify which VM image to use, as well as to supply their ansible script as part of the reservation to automatically customize their VM for diverse workload.
