There are several common types of bid and auction strategies that can be used in e-commerce. Some of these include open auctions (where bids are publicly announced in ascending order), closed auctions (where sealed bids are submitted simultaneously), Dutch auctions (where the auctioneer starts with a high price and drops it until someone calls out a bid), and Vickery auctions (where the winner is the individual submitting the highest bid or, less frequently, the second-highest bid)³. The specific strategy you choose for your decentralized cloud computing platform will depend on your goals and requirements.

In terms of pricing strategies for cloud computing, some common options include on-demand pricing (where customers pay for resources as they use them), spot pricing (where customers bid on unused resources at a discounted rate), reserved instance pricing (where customers reserve resources for a fixed period of time at a discounted rate), and volume discounts or tier-based pricing (where customers receive discounts based on their usage levels)⁷.

Your idea of having host providers publish their intended price and allowing customers to submit their own bidding prices is an interesting one. You could implement this using an open auction format where bids are publicly announced. The host provider could set an internal high and low threshold for acceptable bids, as you mentioned. If a customer's bid falls below the lower threshold, it could be immediately rejected; if it exceeds the upper threshold, it could be immediately accepted; otherwise, it could be placed in a queue to wait for other possible bids until a timer runs out.
