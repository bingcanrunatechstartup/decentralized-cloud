I'm relatively unexperienced in the e-commerce and would like to learn more about the bidding process. What are some common types of bid and auction strategy? Does our context of decentralization changes how they would work, or is it largely the same as in traditional e-commerce? One idea I have is that host provider publish their intended price, then customer submit their bidding price (which can be different). The host provider have an internal high and low threshold - if it is lower than his/her limit, it is immediately rejected (and the lower limit may or may not be revealed to the customer); if it is higher than the threshold, it is immediately accepted, otherwise it is placed in a queue to wait for other possible bids until a timer runs out, then the highest bidder is chosen. A second question I would like to ask is on the types of pricing strategy in cloud computing. Aside from the common per-second billing method, are there any other? What considerations goes into them?
