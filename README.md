## Wait. What?

Joking aside though. The purpose of this experiment is to ask bing to work on a somewhat more challenging project - one that involves something off the beaten path of your usual CRUD app template. Result? Not bad (within the 15 turn * 2000 letter per turn limit, that is) (This one is done after author have carried various less challenging experiments on bing with success. I'm still thinking of how to share the result of those previous experiments)
